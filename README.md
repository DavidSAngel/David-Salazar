# David-Salazar
This is a log of what I am doing like a diary but worse and a lot more boring. As long as I remember.

# About Me
I don't know what to put here.
Is this like a dating profile but for coding.
I like coding in Java and C++.
I can code in HTML, CSS, and some SQL.
I spend too much time watching anime and reading managa.
This is line 10 in my about me, but since I am not cutting these sentence into lines it's just a sentance in my about me.
